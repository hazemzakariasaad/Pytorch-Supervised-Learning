# PyTorch and Supervised Learning  : Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent

This project showcases the implementation of supervised learning using PyTorch framework and the concepts of gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.

## Introduction
Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where a model learns to make predictions based on labeled training data. In this project, we focus on classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the class or category of given input data.

PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that provides efficient tensor computation and automatic differentiation capabilities. It allows us to build and train neural networks effectively.

## Project Overview
The project consists of the following key components:

1. Data Generation:
   - The project begins with the generation of synthetic data using the `make_moons` function from the `sklearn.datasets` module. The data includes two classes and contains a noise factor.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - The generated data is divided into training and validation sets using a specified ratio.
   - The data is then converted into PyTorch tensors for further processing.

3. Model Architecture:
   - The model architecture consists of a linear layer followed by a softmax activation function. It is implemented using PyTorch's tensor operations.

4. Loss Function:
   - The loss function used in this project is the categorical cross-entropy loss, which measures the dissimilarity between predicted and true class probabilities.

5. Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent:
   - The model parameters (weights and biases) are optimized using gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent algorithms.
   - The weights and biases are updated iteratively based on the gradients computed using the backpropagation algorithm.

6. Training and Evaluation:
   - The model is trained over a specified number of epochs using the training data.
   - The loss is calculated for both the training and validation sets during each epoch to monitor the model's performance.

7. Visualization:
   - The project includes visualizations of the training and validation loss curves using the `matplotlib` library.

## Getting Started
To run the project and explore the implementation, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies, including PyTorch and matplotlib.
2. Generate the synthetic data using the provided `make_moons` function or your own dataset.
3. Adjust the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size, to suit your requirements.
4. Run the code and observe the training and validation loss curves.
5. Evaluate the trained model's performance on unseen data or make predictions on new input samples.

## Further Improvements
This project serves as a basic implementation of supervised learning using PyTorch and gradient descent algorithms. Here are some potential areas for further exploration and improvement:

- Experiment with different model architectures, such as adding more layers or using different activation functions.
- Explore different loss functions suitable for your specific classification task.
- Implement regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting.
- Incorporate learning rate schedules or adaptive optimization algorithms, like Adam or RMSprop, for more efficient training.
- Extend the project to handle more complex datasets or multi-class classification problems.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of PyTorch and supervised learning techniques, specifically gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, for classification tasks. By following the steps outlined in the project, you can gain a better understanding of these concepts and adapt them to your own machine learning projects.
